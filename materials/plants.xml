<CONSERVATION>LC</CONSERVATION>
<DESCRIPTION>The Arisaema triphyllum complex includes four closely related species: Arisaema pusillum, Arisaema stewardsonii, Arisaema quinatum, and Arisaema triphyllum sensu stricto. A fifth species (Arisaema acuminatum) is sometimes included but its validity is controversial. Arisaema triphyllum sensu lato is a herbaceous, perennial, flowering plant growing from a corm. It typically grows up to two feet (61 cm) tall,[5] but populations in Georgia and Florida are known to reach almost twice that height. It has 1 or 2 leaves, each with three leaflets (triphyllum). Occasionally the lateral leaflets will be two-parted or lobed, giving the appearance of five leaflets per leaf. One species (A. quinatum) typically has five pseudo-leaflets per leaf. The small, inconspicuous flowers of Jack-in-the-pulpit are borne on a fleshy, spike-like inflorescence called a spadix ("Jack"), which is enclosed (or nearly enclosed) by a large, sometimes colorful bract called a spathe ("pulpit"). The flowers are clustered around the base of the spadix inside the spathe. A sterile spadix appendix protrudes from the mouth of the spathe tube. The appendix is covered by the leafy tip of the spathe, referred to as the spathe hood (or spathe lamina). The lip along the mouth of the spathe tube, used as a landing platform for winged insects, is called the spathe flange.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>Podophyllum peltatum is an herbaceous perennial plant in the family Berberidaceae. Its common names are mayapple, American mandrake, wild mandrake, and ground lemon. It is widespread across most of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. Mayapples are woodland plants, typically growing in colonies derived from a single root. The stems grow to 30â€“40 cm (12 in to 16 in) tall, with palmately lobed umbrella-like leaves up to 20â€“40  cm (8 in to 16 in) diameter with 3â€“9 shallowly to deeply cut lobes. The plants produce several stems from a creeping underground rhizome; some stems bear a single leaf and do not produce any flower or fruit, while flowering stems produce a pair or more leaves with 1â€“8 flowers in the axil between the apical leaves. The flowers are white, yellow or red, 2â€“6 cm (1" to 2") diameter with 6â€“9 petals, and mature into a green, yellow or red fleshy fruit 2â€“5 cm (1 in to 2 in) long.</DESCRIPTION>

The leaves are slender lanceolate, 3â€“14 cm (1+1â„4â€“5+1â„2 in) long and 0.5â€“2 cm (0.20â€“0.79 in) broad, with a 6â€“20 cm (2+1â„4â€“7+3â„4 in) long petiole. The flowers are 0.7â€“1.4 cm (0.28â€“0.55 in) in diameter with five pale pink or white (rarely yellow) petals, and reflect UV light. It has a raceme inflorescence, in which its flowers branch off of the shoot. The individual flowers bloom for three days, although the five stamens on each flower are only active for a single day. Flowering occurs between March and May depending on part of its range and weather. The seeds are between 0.2 and 0.3 cm (0.08 and 0.12 in) in diameter and a shiny black. The seeds are released from the capsule fruit when it breaks open. Elaiosomes are present on the seeds and allow for ant dispersal. Claytonia virginica is a cytologically complex taxon, including diploids with n=6, 7, 8 and 9, and tetraploids, hexaploids, octaploids and dodecaploids. The largest number of chromosomes (2n=ca. 191) was observed in the New York area.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>Trillium grandiflorum is a perennial that grows from a short rhizome and produces a single, showy white flower atop a whorl of three leaves. Flowering stems are 20â€“40 cm tall. The leaves are often called bracts as the "stem" is then considered a peduncle (the rhizome is the stem proper, aboveground shoots of a rhizome are branches or peduncles); the distinction between bracts (found on pedicels or peduncles) and leaves (borne on stems). A single rootstock will often form clonal colonies, which can become very large and dense.</DESCRIPTION>

Members of the genus are known as buttercups, spearworts and water crowfoots. The genus is distributed worldwide, primarily in temperate and montane regions. The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots. Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris. In ornamental gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.</DESCRIPTION>

The leaves form a basal rosette at ground level and spiral up to the flowering stems. The blades are dentate or deeply lobed (pinnatifid). The flowers of many species open in the evening, hence the name "evening primrose". They may open in under a minute. Most species have yellow flowers, but some have white, purple, pink, or red. Most native desert species are white. Oenothera caespitosa, a species of western North America, produces white flowers that turn pink with age. One of the most distinctive features of the flower is the stigma, which has four branches in an X shape.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>California poppy is a perennial or annual plant growing to 5â€“12 in (13â€“30 cm) tall with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage. The leaves are alternately divided into round, lobed segments. The flowers are solitary on long stems, silky-textured, with four petals, each petal 2 to 6 cm (0.79 to 2.36 in) long and broad; flower color ranges through yellow, orange and red. Flowering occurs from February to September in the northern hemisphere. The petals close at night (or in cold, windy weather) and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. The fruit is a slender, dehiscent capsule 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) long, which splits in two, sometimes explosively with an audible snap, to release numerous small 1.5â€“1.8 mm (0.059â€“0.071 in) wide black or dark brown seeds.

The genus is largely confined to North America and part of northeastern Siberia. Common names include shooting star, American cowslip, mosquito bills, mad violets, and sailor caps. A few species are grown in gardens for their showy and unique flower display.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>Lobelia cardinalis is a perennial herbaceous plant which grows up to 1.2 m (4 ft) tall. It is found primarily in wet places, such as riparian zones, riverbanks, bogs or swamps. It is also sometimes found in damp or semi-flooded and shaded forest areas. The plant tends to occupy locations near a water source, providing its roots with consistent hydration via groundwater from the saturated soil. It may be found growing slightly away from or closer to the water, and may even be found growing aquatically, with some or all of the plant submerged and its flowers rising from the surface.</DESCRIPTION>
